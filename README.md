# DEPLOYING-AN-AZURE-P2S-VPN-USING-ENTRA-ID-AS-AUTHENTICATION
In this lab, we will be setting up and configuring Azure point to site VPN using Entra ID (Active Directory) as the authentication.
In accomplishing this, i had my Azure account ready to deploy the resources that will enable me in setting the VPN Gateway.
Resources to deploy are :-
1) A resource group
2) A virtual network  and a gateway subnet
3) A Virtual Network Gateway (VNG)
We already have a Windows VM (Virtual Machine) deployed alongside an Azure VPN client application downloaded from Microsoft store.
